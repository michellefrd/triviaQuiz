Open Font License

    The SIL Open Font License (OFL) is a free, libre and open source license specifically designed for fonts 
    and related software based on our experience in font design and linguistic software engineering.
    The OFL provides a legal framework and infrastructure for worldwide development, sharing and improvement of fonts 
    and related software in a collaborative manner. It enables font authors to release their work under a common license that allows use,
    bundling, modification and redistribution. It encourages shared value, is not limited to any specific 
    computing platform or environment, and can be used by other organizations or individuals.
    The OFL meets the specific needs of typographic design and engineering as well as the gold standards of 
    the FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) community, namely the cultural values and guidelines from 
    the FSF 1, the Debian Free Software Guidelines2, as well as the Open Source Definition3. It draws inspiration 
    from concepts and elements found in other licenses, but our improvements in the specific area of fonts have 
    made the licensing model work better than other approaches currently in use.
    SIL International serves language communities worldwide, building their capacity for sustainable language development,
    by means of research, translation, training and materials development. We have been thinking about more open 
    and participative models for a while, for example through our partnerships with UNESCO (Initiative B@bel) 
    and our work on the Gentium typeface. See  www.sil.org/resources/software_fonts for a detailed list of free/libre 
    and open source software resources provided by SIL.
